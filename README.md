### Hi there 👋!
My name is Christoff Wrobel and I am a mathematician working in the german life insurance business.
More specific, I work on migration projects, focussing on actuarial and technical questions regarding data structures concerning the transformation process of the actuarial relevant data.
Besides this, I work on my actuarial education (Aktuar DAV).

My academical background lies in algebraic geometry. After my studies in mathematics and computer science, 
I started doing my PhD, specializing on combinatorial methods for algebraic varieties with torus action. 
In May 2020 I defended my thesis under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jürgen Hausen.
